**Zenduty – On-call, Intelligently**

Your team is global. Your alerts don’t care about timezones.  
But what if your on-call scheduling did?

Being on-call shouldn't mean getting woken up at 3 AM if someone else is wide awake and ready to help.

Zenduty’s Advanced On-Call Scheduling is built with timezone intelligence so your team can stay responsive and rested.

You just provide us with:  
- Who’s on the team  
- When they usually work  
- Their timezone  

and we take care of the rest.

Rotations can be daily, weekly, or even custom.  
We’ll make sure the right person gets the alert at the right time.

Got holidays coming up? No worries! Just add your holiday calendars, and we’ll skip scheduling people who are off.

And in case no one’s available, you can set a fallback user.

Smart scheduling, happy engineers, and zero missed alerts.  
Try Zenduty’s timezone-aware scheduling and sleep better wherever you are. 

Because... incidents are never meant to disturb your **PEACE**, but to **PROTECT** the system!
